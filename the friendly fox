Once upon a time, no, wait, on a land far away?… no … on a mountain? sure! 
On a mountain far away, it was 5:00am
and the animals started to wake up.
All the animals were happy
because it was the Forest’s two hundredth birthday.  
The animals were happily making yummy food like cookies and cake. 
Other animals were making, packing and wrapping gifts for the wise old tree.
They were even decorating the forest, but the grumpy fox was mean to the animals. 
He took cookies and ate them.  He took gifts and opened them.  
He even took decorations off the trees! 
The wisdom old tree saw this and asked the fox fox why he did this. 
The fox said "because I don't have any friends and nobody invited me to your birthday
party." The tree said "everybody was invited to my birthday party and the reason you don't
have any friends is because you are mean to everyone.
